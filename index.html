            <h2>little bit about me...</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a passionate and creative developer specializing in user-friendly
                software solutions. With a strong background in web development, I
                thrive on turning complex problems into elegant and intuitive designs.
                I believe that great software should not only be functional but also
                delightful to use, and I strive to create experiences that users love.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                My journey in software development began back when I was 13 years old,
                when I was learning how to use a computer I immediately fell in love
                with this world and started to be more curious about how everything
                works, so I started to research and learn by myself. Since then, I've
                honed my skills in web development and a little bit of UI/UX design,
                allowing me to grow my career in software development in a short time.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                I'm constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and
                grow, and I'm excited about the possibility of bringing my unique
                blend of creativity and technical expertise to your team. When I'm not
                coding, you can find me playing some video games, on social activities
                (I'm an extroverted type of person, ENFP-A personality) or even coding
                just for fun! Another interesting thing about me is that right now I'm
                developing an amazing passion for music!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                As you may noticed I'm also passionate about great-designed apps, and
                I try to make a positive impact through my work to achieve this goal.
                I'm always open to new collaborations and projects, so if you're
                looking for a developer who is not only skilled but also passionate
                about creating exceptional user experiences, what are we waiting for?
                let's make beautiful and outstanding apps together!
